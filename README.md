# Google-Style Login System — MERN Stack

This project is a **Google-style authentication system** built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)**.  
It replicates the clean, minimal, dark-themed UI of Google’s real login and account creation pages, complete with centered layouts and a multi-step authentication flow.

The system includes multiple routed pages such as **Sign-In**, **Create Account**, **Email Input**, **Password Creation**, and a **Thank-You** page — all styled closely to Google’s design language.  
This project is ideal for learning authentication concepts, MERN full-stack development, and UI replication.
